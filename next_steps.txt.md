Refer to the attached code.  Change or remove no functionality just add what we discuss.  output can be in sections i will re assemble if the output is too long.  Be clear on what to add and where to add it. 

Done:



To Do:

get S3 Bucket sizes

Add more VPC-related resources:
- Route Tables with routes
- Security Groups with rules
- VPC Endpoints
- VPC Peering connections
- Transit Gateways


2. Add cost estimation:
```python
- EC2 instance hourly costs
- RDS instance costs
- NAT Gateway hourly costs
- Data transfer estimates
```

3. Add filtering options:
```bash
# Examples:
python3 aws_resource_audit.py --tag-filter "Environment=Production"
python3 aws_resource_audit.py --vpc-id vpc-1234567
python3 aws_resource_audit.py --name-filter "*prod*"
```

4. Add export formats:
```python
- CSV format
- HTML report
- PDF report
```

5. Add resource details:
```python
- EC2 instance metrics (CPU, memory usage)
- RDS performance insights
- VPC Flow Logs info
- Resource tags
```

Great! A few suggestions to enhance the script further:

1. Add more resource types:
```python
# Add these to audit:
- ECS Clusters and Services
- Lambda Functions
- S3 Buckets
- IAM Users and Roles
- Elastic Load Balancers
- Auto Scaling Groups
```

2. Add formatting options:
```python
# Add color coding for statuses:
- Green for running/available
- Red for stopped/unavailable
- Yellow for transitioning states
```

3. Add filtering options:
```python
# Add command line arguments like:
--regions us-east-1,us-west-2  # Specific regions only
--services ec2,rds,vpc         # Specific services only
--output-dir /path/to/save     # Custom output location
```

4. Add cost estimation:
```python
# Add pricing information:
- EC2 hourly rates
- RDS instance costs
- Storage costs
```

Would you like me to implement any of these enhancements?

Also, you might want to add comments to the top of your script to document:
- Requirements
- Usage instructions
- AWS credentials setup
- Output format details

Would you like me to add any of these improvements?
